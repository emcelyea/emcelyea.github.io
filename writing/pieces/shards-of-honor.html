                       Shards of Honor is a story about the forbidden love of Cordelia and Vorkosigan, a couple who come from two cultures that are at war. They interact 
                       across different battlefields over a number of years before resigning their military positions and moving to Vorkosigans home planet together.
                       <br/><br/>
                       The story could have explored deeper into the conflict between duty to society and your own desires. That felt like the central conflict of the story, but it turns into 
                       more of a political thriller set in space. The characters interactions are so brief and shallow that the love story doesn't really feel believable, and
                        the conflicts between duty and love that they do encounter are always easily overcome without issues. 
                        At one point the female protaganist is involved in murdering her lovers commanding officer, something that should have resulted in real consequences,
                        but she hides in his bathroom for a few days and the problem sort of goes away. Bujold really could have drawn me in more if the couples trials had real danger behind them.
                       <br/><br/>
                       This book also has a bit of a pro-militaristic slant. It doesn't go nearly as far as Starship Troopers in its worship of battlefield honor and 
                       military duty, but it does celebrate some aspects of warrior culture and duty driven societies. Barrayar, Vorkosigans culture is an aristocratic and heavily militaristic society.
                       The leaders of Barrayar are all part of its "warrior" class. This is another interesting element to the story that I wish Bujold explored more. There is
                       an appeal to being honorable, and nobly performing duties for your society, but that kind of idealism is easily exploitable. That lesson is 
                       implied at times but it is another point she could have explored more.
                       <br/><br/>
                       Shards of Honor was an enjoyable read and Bujold is a better writer than your average sci-fi/fantasy author. If she had put the characters in real danger and 
                       explored the differences between their two cultures more it would have been more impactful for me. It is an action packed romp that follows an inexplicable romance across space,
                       but it fails to ever feel like much more than a good time.
