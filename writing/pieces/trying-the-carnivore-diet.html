                    <p>
                        It feels like an environmental nightmare and something that will be a struggle to get through, but I am going to do 4 weeks of just: beef, chicken, fish and eggs.
                    </p>
                    <p>What swayed me is Dave Macleods recent trial of eating only Mcdonalds (surprisingly 100%) beef patties for 8 weeks. I had been tempted to try it before but his 
                        great results were what finally pushed me into going for it. I am a big fan of diet experiments, the only way you can really know what will work for your
                        specific body is to try it out.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rules are simple: Only the 4 ingredients listed above, can eat as much and whenever I want.<br/>
                    Factors I want to monitor: Energy levels, Gut activity, Climbing strength (will come up with some measures), and mood.</p>
                    <p>I am easing into it for 4 days currently. Going cold off of carbs is no fun. Will start officially on April 1st but this isn't a joke it is just a coincidence.</p>
