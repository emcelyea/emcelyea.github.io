                        Approach this book with no context. Being baffled and then slowly drawn into the mystery of it is it's main appeal. 
                        That means stop reading here if you intend to read this book.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Nabokov wrote a book that is written by a fictional character named Charles Kinbote. The book is supposed to be "Pale Fire", the final poem of the
                        famous poet John Shade. It starts with a comically long introduction, followed by the 1000 line poem, followed by 200 pages 
                        of critical analysis of the poem. At first this felt like a commentary on art and interpretation of art. 90% of the books contents are not
                        the poem readers bought the book for, but analysis of it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The poem itself is also... not good at some points and exceedingly good at others. It leaves you feeling a bit off-kilter and suspicious about what 
                        Kinbotes objectives are. After his effusive introduction you are hit with John Shades bland verses that reads like an old man describing what he sees out his window.
                        The poem wends through multiple themes, getting very good around Canto 2 & 3. The rest of the book is Kinbotes analysis of the poem.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The passages in the analysis can be long and verbose. They are almost all comically unrelated to the poem but reveal aspects of Kinbotes past and his 
                        relationship with shade. Trying to resolve the mysteries around Kinbote are what keep the book engaging. 

                        <br/><br/>
                        How insane is Kinbote? Did he edit Pale Fire, what is his relationship with Shade? Who is Kinbote actually? Those are a few of the unresolved 
                        questions I walked away from the book with, but I think a closer second reading might clarify them.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This book was a bit of a challenge as Kinbotes analysis of the poem would sometimes involve pages long tangents with seemingly no connection
                        to the underlying plot. That taxed my ability to stay engaged but ultimately reading this cover to cover was worth it.
