                        You should approach this book with no context. Being baffled and then slowly drawn into it's mystery is it's main appeal. 
                        The book is a 1000 line poem followed by a lengthy critical analysis of it. The poem was written by the fictional poet John Shade 
                        and the critical analysis is done by his "friend" Charles Kinbote who has absconded with the poem after Shade's death.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The appeal of this book is the mystery embedded in Kinbote's analysis. Kinbote might be a confused admirer or he may be a completely unhinged murderer.
                        The reality can only be discerned from hints he drops in his analysis, which is mostly long tangents that have nothing to do with the poem. 
                        Nabokov pulls off a highly stylized work here. The actual narrative of the book is embedded in Kinbote's analysis, which forces readers to glean the events
                        that occured between Kinbote, Shade and his final poem by reading between the lines. I thought it was an interesting way to write a story, but it can be a pain to read. 
                        When Kinbote would launch into 10 pages of made up history about his fictional homeland it left me wishing he was a little less insane.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This book was a bit of a challenge but pushing through challenging books reminds me that I am smarter than everyone else so it is an important practice.
