                        This is a collection of 15 short stories. The strongest pieces in the book layer modern and historical Chinese experiences 
                        with some element of science fiction or Chinese mythology. This is best portrayed in "The Literomancer", "The Man Who Ended History" and 
                        "The Paper Menagerie" (the titular piece).
                        <br/><br/>
                        "The Literomancer" weaves a fascinating form of divination that uses handwritten Chinese characters with the American CIA brutally trying to root
                        out communists in cold war era China. "The Paper Menagerie" uses living origami to to penetrate the divide between a Chinese immigrant mother and her
                        son as he grows up in America. The mystical elements in these stories give them much more weight than they would have without them. These are 
                        interesting but well explored areas, but the author does a great job using mystical elements to make the lessons in them land with real impact. He 
                        carries this over to "The Man Who Ended History" when he addresses a less spoken of part of World War 2, Unit 731. This would be an interesting story
                        without the sci-fi concepts, but they enhance it and make you really consider the erasure of history when it becomes literally possible.
                        <br/><br/>
                        My big takeaway from these works is how powerful tying mysticism and science fiction in with reality can be. The authors job is less to uncover
                        some profound new truth than to make ideas compelling. To paraphrase (or butcher) Emily Dickinson "Style is what makes them care"
                        and Liu does a good job taking well trod topics like "The CIA did bad things during the Cold War", and turning them into something that feels
                        new. Weaving science fiction and historical fiction together makes past events come to life in new ways.
                        <br/><br/>
                        My main points of contention with this book were with two stories. In "All The Flavors" the author goes a bit hard on the pro-china anti-america rhetoric.
                        The story revolves around a group of Chinese immigrants during the California gold rush. The Americans in this story are at best stupid and lazy and at worst
                        racist and criminal. It also tries to make a compelling case for why we should eat dogs, something I will never agree with. Telling me it is ok to eat dogs because 
                        they are "just animals" is like telling a christian it is ok to pee on a crucifix because Jesus is "just some guy". They have been our loyal companions
                        for 15,000+ years. A 15,000+ year relationship based on faith that we won't harm one another is sacred. Eating dogs is sacrosanct. That aside it was an interesting 
                        story but the eating dogs thing really turned me against it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The other story I felt conflicted about was "The Paper Menagerie". In it, a Chinese woman marries an older American man. Their young son grows to scorns his heritage and jumps into american
                        lifestyles. The mom makes him origami animals that come to life and play with him, but as he gets older he abandons those as well. He moves out and doesnt talk
                        to his mother much. Time passes and she dies. After her death he discovers his origami animals again and finds a deathbed letter from her explaining how
                        his abandonment hurt her, and how she yearned for him to participate in Chinese culture with her. The son feels terribly guilty, cries and the story ends.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This story was pretty touching but ultimately I found the mom to be self-centered and useless. She refused to indoctrinate herself or meet her son halfway, instead placing 100% of her happiness
                        on his young shoulders. Then after yoking him with that weight for his entire life she finally dies. She has one last barb left though, a letter detailing her sad life, her hopes
                        for her son, and how he let her down completely. This story shows the different roles children are expected to play culturally. From an American perspective
                        a child moving out and seperating themselves from their parent is viewed as natural, but in this story the mother is fine with the idea that her child inherently owes her something.
                        I can see both perspectives but attacking someone from beyond the grave should be reserved for your worst enemies, not children who didn't call you often enough.
                        <br/><br/>
                        "The Paper Menagerie" is a great collection and made me tear up a few times. It also exposed me to some historical events I had little idea of and mythologies I had not encountered before.
                        Some of the stories did not land as well as others, but that is expected with short story collections.
