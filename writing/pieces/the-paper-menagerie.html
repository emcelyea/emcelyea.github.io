                        This is a collection of 15 short stories. The strongest pieces in the book layer modern and historical Chinese experiences 
                        with elements of science fiction and Chinese mythology. This is best portrayed in "The Literomancer", "The Man Who Ended History" and 
                        "The Paper Menagerie" (the titular piece).
                        <br/><br/>
                        "The Literomancer" weaves a fascinating form of divination that uses handwritten Chinese characters with the American CIA brutally trying to root
                        out communists in cold war era China. "The Paper Menagerie" uses living origami to to penetrate the divide between a Chinese immigrant mother and her
                        son as he grows up in America. The mystical elements in these stories give them much more weight than they would have without them. The mythological elements make the lessons
                        in them land with real impact.
                        <br/><br/>
                        My big takeaway from these works is how powerful tying mysticism and science fiction to reality can be. The authors job is less to uncover
                        some profound new truth than to make ideas compelling. To paraphrase (or butcher) Emily Dickinson "Style is what makes them care"
                        and Liu does a good job taking well trod topics like "The CIA did bad things during the Cold War", and adding his unique style to them to make them feel
                        new. Weaving science fiction and historical fiction together makes past events come to life in new ways. In "The Man Who Ended History" he confronts the erasure
                        of a horrible historic event by introducing futuristic technology that lets us revisit and also erase history. Erasure of historical events is a fascinating thing to 
                        bring to light. Doing it in the context of fictional technology that can literally erase history makes it even more impactful.
                        <br/><br/>
                        My main points of contention with this book were with two stories. In "All The Flavors" the author goes a bit hard on the pro-china anti-america rhetoric.
                        The story revolves around a group of Chinese immigrants during the California gold rush. The Americans in this story are at best stupid and lazy and at worst
                        racist and criminal. It also tries to make a compelling case for why we should eat dogs, something I will never agree with. That aside it was an interesting 
                        story and I really enjoyed how mythology empowered the characters through their modern struggles.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The other story I felt conflicted about was "The Paper Menagerie". In it, a Chinese woman marries an older American man. Their young son grows to scorns his heritage and jumps into american
                        lifestyles. The mom makes him origami animals that come to life and play with him, but as he gets older he abandons those as well. He moves out and doesnt talk
                        to his mother much. Time passes and she dies. After her death he gets a deathbed letter from her explaining how
                        he hurt her. The son feels terribly guilty, cries and the story ends.
                        <br/><br/>
                        This story was pretty touching but ultimately I found the mom to be self-centered. She refused to meet her son halfway, instead placing 100% of her happiness
                        on his young shoulders. Then after yoking him with that weight for his entire life she dies, leaving him a letter detailing her sadness, her hopes
                        for her son, and how he let her down completely. This shows the different roles children are expected to play culturally. From an American perspective
                        the son moving out and seperating himself from his parents is viewed as natural, but in this story the mother seems to feel her children inherently owe their parents.
                        I can see both perspectives but attacking someone from beyond the grave should be reserved for your worst enemies, not children who didn't call you often enough.
                        <br/><br/>
                        "The Paper Menagerie" is a great collection and made me tear up a few times. It also exposed me to some historical events I had little idea of and mythologies I had not encountered before.
                        Some of the stories did not land as well as others, but that is expected with short story collections.
