                        </div>
                        <i>ROUGH DRAFT</i>
                    <p>    
                        This is one of the classic startup books and one that didn't leave me questioning my morality (I am looking at you "Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products").
                        It is full of great information and definitely inspires you to get out and interact with people, but the hard pitch and sales aspects still make me curl up. I may 
                        have been traumatized by doing door to door sales as a teenager, and doing a hard sale or wringing a commitment out of another person makes me feel awkard. Fortunately that
                        is a small part of the book, as he shows that market research and product validation is just going out and talking to people. I love talking to people, and people love talking
                        about themselves and their problems, so this felt very doable.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Rob is very committed to solving real problems in this book. One thing he missed is that products of attempt to create the problem they solve. Those products usually feel immoral and 
                        predatory, which may be why he never discusses it, or it may be way harder to pull off. For example he discusses validating a hypothetical home workout fitness app. The conversation goes something like:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <i><b>Rob:</b> How often do you go to the gym.<br/>
                        <b>P:</b> Almost never.<br/>
                        <b>Rob:</b> What are some of your big goals right now.<br/>
                        <b>P:</b> Fixing up my house, doing well at work, spending time with my wife.<br/>
                        <b>Rob:</b> Are you worried about physical health.<br/>
                        <b>P:</b> I feel fine so not really.<br/>
                        Done</i>
                        <br/><br/>
                        Robs analysis of this is that the guy does not care about fitness, is not worried about health, and an app that lets him workout at home would be useless. 
                        What he leaves out is the range of predatory angles fitness can take: "Do you want to be more attractive?", "Do you want to improve your sex life?",
                        "Are you worried about a heart attack?". There are a whole host of fears and insecurities that could drive someone to buy a fitness app. 
                        There are a huge number of emotions that can drive people, but Rob really sticks to the more "businessey" ones, like convenience, performance and cost savings.
                        <br/><br/>
                        If you really drill into what emotion a product is touching on it becomes more philosophical and less practical. That may be why Rob never addresses it, but
                        tt may be useful to understand the root emotions around peoples problems though. Take the gym example: "Do you want to be more attractive?",
                        sure everyone does, but why? Sex, admiration, confidence, favorable treatment, could all be positive by products of being more attractive, but if we keep drilling down into those (why be more confident?)
                        we run into the quote by Nietzsche:
                        <br/><br/>
                        <i>
                        <span style="margin-left:16px;">
                            "What is good? — All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself.<br/> 
                        </span><span style="margin-left:16px;"> What is bad? — All that is born of weakness.<br/>
                        </span><span style="margin-left:16px;">  What is happiness? — The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome." 
                        </span></i><br/><br/>
                        Nietzsche is saying that empowerment is good, weakness is bad, and the movement between those two is the root of happy and sad feelings. You can 
                        agree or disagree with Nietzsche's take but what I find important here is the duality of these two motivators: Desire for power and fear of less power.
                        Anytime you offer to empower someone in some way you are also pointing out that they are currently operating in a weakened state.
                        <br/><br/>
                        To bring this back to "The Mom Test", Rob really seems to focus on empowering customers in areas where the weaknesses are less predatory. Using spreadsheets inefficiently
                         is less likely to drive someone than something like fear of heart disease, it is not really an exploitable weakness. This is really the only moral way to build things, and 
                         if you use "The Mom Test" method of talking and learning your customers struggles you will end up building with the goal of strengthening them in mind.

                         <br/><br/>
                         This has been a bit rambly but to summarize "The Mom Test" is packed with valuable information but it never really drills into the philisophical elements of building 
                         something. Really looking at your product and figuring out core emotions around it is important.
                         <br/>For Example:
                         <ul>
                             <li>You are building an app that helps collectors display their collectibles and meet other collectors <br/><i>What motivations would users have</i></li>
                             <ul>
                                <li>Admiration - They want to be admired for what they have collected</li>
                                <li>Greed - They want to sell their things and make a profit</li>
                                <li>Fear - Their collection is worthless and will be a hassle for their family when they die</li>
                                <li>Fear - Their collection is valuable but will be mismanaged when they die</li>
                            </ul>
                         </ul>
                         Rob would really hone in on the Greed motivation here, customers talking about their desire for admiration or their fears would probably be discarded
                         as signals that this product is a no go. After more thought I think I agree with him, but it is a useful exercise to correlate problems with their emotions
                         and then let those guide product direction. If we are building an app and our customers are being driven by a desire to make money that motivation should
                         be addressed in the landing page, feature decisions and overall design. Same thing for any emotion you can correlate to your product.
